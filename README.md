### Displays stuff for the multiple project

This is a tool for creating diagrams for the multiplicated genes. Includes the
following tracks: ORF and introns (if any), repetitive regions (as predicted
from hits), aligned PacBio reads and aligned transcriptome Illumina reads.

A separate diagram is created for every gene.
